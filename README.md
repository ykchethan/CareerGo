"# CareerGo" 
The Careers Go project is similar to a job portal with the additional feature of having career guidance as a smaller module at the start. The data flowing through the portal will be intended to use or uses of the companies who have their profile created with the job openings posted in it and also the applicants who are in search of job opportunities.
The special feature is the evaluation of studentsâ€™ profiles. Here, there is career support, where
students can live chat and send the resume and profile indeed shared automatically to 3-4(at the start) verified career counselors.
